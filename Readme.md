# Group 1's Devops Project: Automatic book borrowing system
To encourage and increase the number of people reading and loaning books from
public libraries, we implemented an automated book loan and return system. The system
consists of a frontend Application and a Raspberry pi to act as a physical kiosk.
To connect the 2 platforms we use firebase to store data about each person's profile
and each book's data
