# Group 1's DevOps Project: Automatic Book Borrowing System

## Overview

The *Automatic Book Borrowing System* is designed to encourage and increase book
borrowing from public libraries by providing an automated reservation, collection,
and return system.

The system integrates:
- A **frontend application** (mobile app / web app), and
- A **Raspberry Pi–based physical kiosk** for book collection and returns.

Firebase is used as the central database to store:
- User profiles
- Book information
- Reservation and borrowing records
